# Challonge-for-.NET
This is a repository that implements the Challonge API in .NET. This is a gift from PG Arena to the world! 

https://pgarena.com (Implementing a new tournament platform!) 

I remember seeing this project: https://github.com/AlejandroGC/Challonge.NET

Unfortunately there were no new commits with the remaning features. This code implements most (not all) of Challonge's API.

It's very straightforward to use. 
I will write a complete tutorial on how to use this correctly in the following days!
